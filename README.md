## Introduction
`simplecv`, as its name said, is a **simple** computer vision crate implemented in Rust. It is still in active development.

1. Simple interface: based on [ndarray](https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray), all functions in `simplecv` are easy to use for developers who are familar with MATLAB or numpy + OpenCV.
2. Simple dependency: only `ndarray` and `image` are required by `simplecv`, so it is simple to install and intergrate.
